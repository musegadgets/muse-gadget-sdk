/*
 * UI timing for the bench (CONFIG_MUSE_PERF, in devices/sdkconfig.muse-bench),
 * logged on mg.perf, so it also reaches the Nordic UART mirror:
 *
 * - every CONFIG_MUSE_PERF_PERIOD_MS: frames drawn and their rate, frame time
 *   split into render, waiting for the panel and the flush callback, pixels
 *   per frame, the avatar's frame tick, free internal RAM, and each task's
 *   share of the CPU over the period;
 * - each touch: touch interrupt -> LVGL reads it -> first flush -> frame done;
 * - each talk press: press -> mode change -> the UI picks it up -> first
 *   flush -> frame done.
 *
 * Bench console commands (muse_perf_console, from '>' lines) inject touch
 * gestures through the touch input's read callback, so LVGL's whole path runs
 * as for a finger (gesture detection, scrolling, the tileview's snap), with the
 * real controller ignored meanwhile:
 *
 *   swipe=left|right|up|down[,ms]   across the middle 3/4 of the screen (250 ms)
 *   drag=x0,y0,x1,y1,ms             press, move, release
 *   tap=x,y                         an 80 ms press
 *   mark=text                       a marker line in the log
 *   bufs=N                          two draw buffers of N lines instead
 *   cf=native|swapped               draw RGB565 or byte-swapped RGB565
 *   prof=on|off                     also log where each gesture's render time
 *                                   went, by LVGL function and draw task type
 *
 * Each gesture logs one line from its press to 300 ms after the last frame of
 * its scroll or animation: frames and rate, frame time (avg, p95, max; render,
 * panel wait, flush), pixels, the longest stretch without a flush, slow frames,
 * the pages it went between, and each task's CPU share meanwhile.
 *
 * Without CONFIG_MUSE_PERF every call is an empty inline.
