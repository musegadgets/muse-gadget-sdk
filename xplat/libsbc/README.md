# libsbc

Google's SBC (Bluetooth subband codec) encoder and decoder, the default codec
of the musegadgets BLE protocol: 16 kHz mono, 16 blocks, 8 subbands, loudness
allocation. One copy serves both SDKs: the ESP32 component
[`esp32/components/libsbc`](../../esp32/components/libsbc) and the Zephyr
build ([`zephyr/cmake/mg_common.cmake`](../../zephyr/cmake/mg_common.cmake))
compile these sources with their own options.

|---|---|
| Upstream | https://github.com/google/libsbc |
| Version | commit `6e505650145c9973d08a0bdd5e5f5e1914305e40` (2022-09-13, "fix: Limit bitpool to positive compression ratio") |
| License | Apache-2.0, Copyright 2022 Google LLC. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). The optimizations are by Meta Platforms, Inc. and affiliates under the same license. |

This is not the BlueZ SBC library, which is LGPL. Don't replace it with that.

## What's upstream and what's ours

The sources are an optimized build of upstream from Meta's codec benchmark
(the `gsbcopt` tree). The changes are compile-time options; with all of them
off the code is upstream, and with them on the output stays bit-exact with
upstream (776 encoder and decoder comparisons over 196 stream configurations:
16 to 48 kHz, 4 to 16 blocks, 4 and 8 subbands, bitpools 19 to 53). Each
changed file says so in its header. The standalone tools, Makefiles and the
Arm assembly of the benchmark tree are left out.

| File | From |
|---|---|
| `include/sbc.h` | upstream, modified: trimming options (`SBC_MAX_CHANNELS`, `SBC_MSBC_ONLY`, `SBC_PLC`) |
| `src/sbc.c` | upstream, modified: symmetric DCT (`SBC_FAST_DCT`), 16-entry CRC table (`SBC_SMALL_CRC`), Arm dual-MAC windowing (`SBC_DSP`), mono and 8-subband trimming |
| `src/bits.c`, `src/bits.h` | upstream, modified: optional single-unit inlining (`SBC_UNITY`) |
| `LICENSE` | upstream, unmodified |
| `README.md` | Meta |

## Build options

| Option | Effect | ESP32 | Zephyr |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SBC_MAX_CHANNELS=1` | mono-only state (halves the codec RAM); changes `struct sbc`, so every user of `sbc.h` needs it | on | on |
| `SBC_WITH_4SB=0` | drops 4-subband support | on | on |
| `SBC_SMALL_CRC=1` | a 16-entry CRC table instead of 256 | on | on |
| `SBC_FAST_DCT=1` | symmetric analysis matrixing | on | on |
| `SBC_DSP=1` | Armv7E-M/Armv8-M dual-MAC windowing | off (Xtensa, RISC-V) | on with a DSP extension (Cortex-M33) |
| `SBC_UNITY=1` | `bits.c` compiled into `sbc.c` so the bit writer inlines | off | with `SBC_DSP` |
| `SBC_MSBC_ONLY`, `SBC_PLC` | mSBC-only build, packet loss concealment | off | off |

## Numbers

16 kHz speech at 60.8 kb/s, PESQ-WB 4.35 for upstream and this build alike:

| | Upstream | This build |
|---|---|---|
| Encoder code + data, ESP32-S3 | 5.8 KB | 3.7 KB |
| Encoder, Xtensa (ESP32 in QEMU) | 2.8 MIPS | 2.6 MIPS |
| Encoder, RV32IMC (ESP32-C3 in QEMU, stands in for the C6 and C5) | 2.3 MIPS | 2.0 MIPS |
| Encoder stack | 880 B | 704 B |
| Encoder, Cortex-M33 (emulator, `-O2`, `SBC_DSP`) | | 14.8k instructions per frame (1.9 MIPS), 3.2 KB flash, 372 B static RAM |

## Updating

Copy `include/` and `src/` (without `arm-v7em/`) from the new tree and keep
the modification notes in the file headers. Then run
`python3 -m unittest tests.test_mg_codecs` from `esp32/` (it encodes speech
and decodes it back with this decoder), and `zephyr/tests/run_all.sh unit`.
